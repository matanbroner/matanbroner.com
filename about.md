My name is Matan Broner and I am a MSc student of Computer Science at Texas A&M University. I am currently a member of the LENSS research group where I study end-to-end 5G security. Overall, my interests are in distributed systems, networks, security, and web development.

Aside from that I like to take on interesting side projects related to web development, networks, and anything else I to read about and wish to experiment with. I have long wanted a space where I can document my thoughts regarding my work. I hope you find my writings enjoyable.
